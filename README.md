### Career & Education

Having done high school and briefly a year of chemical engineering in British Columbia, I moved to Edmonton alongside my family a couple of years ago and refocused myself towards programming and game development as a hobbies of mine I've had for years and deeply enjoy. Having completed the Game Programming stream of Digital Media and IT at NAIT, I am currently continuing work on more substantial projects and rounding out my understanding of fields like Web Design while working in sales for various locations in downtown Edmonton.

### Hobby Projects

 During my time at NAIT and afterwards, I've worked on many personal games or other applications for the sake of game jams, portfolio work, or personal reasons. These projects can be found at [my website](https://nkactus.com/), including games made for various engines such as Godot, Unity, and Unreal Engine, as well as some projects that have included XR/VR support.

### Equipment & Technology Experience

Outside of a broad experience with several coding languages, I have also worked with a couple of different control schemes or peripherals for video games and other programs, including VR technology and touch screens.
